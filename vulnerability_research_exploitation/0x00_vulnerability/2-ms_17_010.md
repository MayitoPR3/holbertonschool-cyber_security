# 2. CVE Research Using NVD

**What is the CVE ID for the vulnerability?**

- The identifier is CVE-2017-0144

**Provide a detailed description of the vulnerability.**

- The vulnerability lies in the SMBv1 server implementation in multiple Microsoft Windows versions (including Vista SP2, Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8.1, Server 2008/2012/2016, Windows RT 8.1, etc.)

- It allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by sending specially crafted packets to the SMBv1 service.

**What is the CVSS score for this vulnerability?**

The CVSS v3.1 base score is 8.8 (HIGH) with the following vector:
AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

- Attack Vector: Network

- Attack Complexity: Low

- Privileges Required: Low

- User Interaction: None

- Scope: Unchanged

- Confidentiality / Integrity / Availability Impact: High

**What are the potential impacts of exploiting this vulnerability?**

- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, perform man-in-the-middle attacks, create denial of service conditions, or execute arbitrary code.

- Systems can be compromised, allowing attackers to install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full privileges.

- The impact ratings across confidentiality, integrity, and availability are all high, demonstrating complete compromise.

**Are there any known mitigations or patches available for this vulnerability?**

- Microsoft released a critical security update in bulletin MS17-010 (March 14, 2017) addressing several SMBv1 vulnerabilities including CVE-2017-0144. This update corrects how SMBv1 handles crafted requests.

- The recommended mitigation is to apply the MS17-010 patch on all vulnerable systems without delay.

- A more proactive measure is to disable SMBv1 entirely, as it's obsolete and unsafeâ€”Microsoft itself has recommended its removal for better security posture.
